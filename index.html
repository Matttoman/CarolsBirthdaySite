        <h2>A Birthday Poem</h2>
        <p>
            For ever wave, for ever float and shine<br>
            Before my yearning eyes, oh! dream of mine<br>
            Wherein I dreamed that time was like a vine,<br>
            <br>
            A creeping rose, that clomb a height of dread<br>
            Out of the sea of Birth, all filled with dead,<br>
            Up to the brilliant cloud of Death o’erhead.<br>
            <br>
            This vine bore many blossoms, which were years.<br>
            Their petals, red with joy, or bleached by tears,<br>
            Waved to and fro i’ the winds of hopes and fears.<br>
            <br>
            Here all men clung, each hanging by his spray.<br>
            Anon, one dropped; his neighbor ’gan to pray;<br>
            And so they clung and dropped and prayed, alway.<br>
            <br>
            But I did mark one lately-opened bloom,<br>
            Wherefrom arose a visible perfume<br>
            That wrapped me in a cloud of dainty gloom.<br>
            <br>
            And rose—an odor by a spirit haunted—<br>
            And drew me upward with a speed enchanted,<br>
            Swift floating, by wild sea or sky undaunted,<br>
            <br>
            Straight through the cloud of death, where men are free.<br>
            I gained a height, and stayed and bent my knee.<br>
            Then glowed my cloud, and broke and unveiled thee.<br>
            <br>
            “O flower-born and flower-souled!” I said,<br>
            “Be the year-bloom that breathed thee ever red,<br>
            Nor wither, yellow, down among the dead.<br>
            <br>
            “May all that cling to sprays of time, like me,<br>
            Be sweetly wafted over sky and sea<br>
            By rose-breaths shrining maidens like to thee!”<br>
            <br>
            Then while we sat upon the height afar<br>
            Came twilight, like a lover late from war,<br>
            With soft winds fluting to his evening star.<br>
            <br>
            And the shy stars grew bold and scattered gold,<br>
            And chanting voices ancient secrets told,<br>
            And an acclaim of angels earthward rolled.<br>
        </p>
